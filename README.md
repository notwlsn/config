# My Dotfiles
Not my full setup, slowly adding the bigger files. Free for anyone to use, and some of these are forked from people who are credited in the file comments

### Usage
I haven't made an install script yet (on the TODO). They're just regular config files, rename and move (i.e. `mv bashrc ~/.bashrc`)

### #TODO
- Slowly add other stuff like i3gaps and full nvim/vim (with plugins) configs
- Create `install.sh`
- Update README with list of files

#### What is Brew?
Homebrew, a Mac package manager, see [here.](https://brew.sh/ "Homebrew website") The `brew/casks` directory here are all of the Brew packages I have installed, and the `brew/leaves` directory are all (some) of the Bash utilities I have installed. Running `dump.sh` will dump the packages you have installed in the same format if you're on a Mac.
