# 08-25-2022: Retiring this script in favor of Ansible playbooks. Installing software via this method was never really meant to be sustainable, just a quick and dirty need of the time. Ansible playbooks for typical build environments of mine may be added at a later date.

#This is starting to leave scope here. It's becoming less dotfile focused and more  or less an ansible playbook. And I'm alright with that, but I should probably warn other people or break it off into an environment setup script for new VMs.
